Machine learning assignment 2
This exercise  implements one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.

Excercise objectives
1. Compute cost function with regularization
2. Compute parameters using gradient descent
3. Use One vs all classifier to get predictions
4. Get predictions from pre trained neural network
